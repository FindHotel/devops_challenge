## FindHotel DevOps Assessment

### Task

Picture yourself working as part of a team that is developing a service that will expose an API.

As the only person with Ops experience, you are responsible for the automation of the DevOps life cycle that will be used by the team.

There is an initial version of the API that you can use (the application on this repo). However, there is no automation whatsoever.

The goal for this iteration is to have the application deployed to a production-like environment with the required automation in place.

Thus, on this iteration, you will be working to deliver at least these items:

- Containerize the simple Sinatra application provided in this repository;
- Deploy the container in a **Cloud Provider** of your choice using a **container ready service** of your choice;
- Use an **infrastructure as code software** of your choice to create the infrastructure.
- Automate release/deployment by using the **CI/CD tool** of your choice;
- Justify architectural choices and what items you would put in the backlog for the next iteration.

Tips from your tech lead:

- Keep in mind the Developers Experience;
- The deployed infra will be operated by our team.
- Ask me if you need more information.

Tips from your P.O.:

- Try to deliver as much as you can in a reasonable amount of hours. Previous attempts took on between 4 and 8 hours;
- Ask me if you need more information.
